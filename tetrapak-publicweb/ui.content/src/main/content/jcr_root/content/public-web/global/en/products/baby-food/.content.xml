Product diversification to focus on health and fitness, organic, ethical and sustainable products, as well as fortification with functional ingredients to support immune systems, aid sleep and reduce risk of allergies, for example, are major trends that places high demands on your production and product innovation. Consumers also prioritise quality and safety over price, demanding a strong, safe brand image and good health credentials."/>
