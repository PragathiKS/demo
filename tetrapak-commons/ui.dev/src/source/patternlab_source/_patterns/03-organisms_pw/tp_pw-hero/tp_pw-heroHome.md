The hero is always placed directly under the header. The purpose of the hero is to offer a place to put a description to a page and to offer a place for aspirational imagery. In logged in state, the hero could be used to show soft conversion content. The hero element with a straight finish should primarily be used on pages hierarchically located below the home page in the sitemap.
